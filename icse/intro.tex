\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item JavaScript is a essential programming language in client-sides.
  \item Because of its complicated semantics, it is not easy to understand JavaScript program behaviors.
  \item Several exisiting proposed formal semantics of JavaScript, but these have the following limitations.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Fully manual implementation of parsers and interpreters.
      \item Supported only fixed version of ECMAScript (in most cases, ES 5.1).
    \end{itemize}
  \item We propose a way to automatically extract semantics from ECMAScript specifications and deal with its annual updates.
\end{itemize}

Our contributions are:

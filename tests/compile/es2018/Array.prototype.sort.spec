          1. Perform an implementation-dependent sequence of calls to the [[Get]] and [[Set]] internal methods of _obj_, to the DeletePropertyOrThrow and HasOwnProperty abstract operation with _obj_ as the first argument, and to SortCompare (described below), such that:
            * The property key argument for each call to [[Get]], [[Set]], HasOwnProperty, or DeletePropertyOrThrow is the string representation of a nonnegative integer less than _len_.
            * The arguments for calls to SortCompare are values returned by a previous call to the [[Get]] internal method, unless the properties accessed by those previous calls did not exist according to HasOwnProperty. If both prospective arguments to SortCompare correspond to non-existent properties, use *+0* instead of calling SortCompare. If only the first prospective argument is non-existent use +1. If only the second prospective argument is non-existent use -1.
            * If _obj_ is not sparse then DeletePropertyOrThrow must not be called.
            * If any [[Set]] call returns *false* a *TypeError* exception is thrown.
            * If an abrupt completion is returned from any of these operations, it is immediately returned as the value of this function.
          1. Return _obj_.

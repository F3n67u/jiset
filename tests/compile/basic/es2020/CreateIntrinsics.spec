        1. Let _intrinsics_ be a new Record.
        1. Set _realmRec_.[[Intrinsics]] to _intrinsics_.
        1. Set fields of _intrinsics_ with the values listed in <emu-xref href="#table-7"></emu-xref>. The field names are the names listed in column one of the table. The value of each field is a new object value fully and recursively populated with property values as defined by the specification of each object in clauses 18-26. All object property values are newly created object values. All values that are built-in function objects are created by performing CreateBuiltinFunction(<steps>, <slots>, _realmRec_, <prototype>) where <steps> is the definition of that function provided by this specification, <slots> is a list of the names, if any, of the function's specified internal slots, and <prototype> is the specified value of the function's [[Prototype]] internal slot. The creation of the intrinsics and their properties must be ordered to avoid any dependencies upon objects that have not yet been created.
        1. Perform AddRestrictedFunctionProperties(_intrinsics_.[[%Function.prototype%]], _realmRec_).
        1. Return _intrinsics_.

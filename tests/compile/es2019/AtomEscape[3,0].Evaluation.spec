          1. Search the enclosing |Pattern| for an instance of a |GroupSpecifier| for a |RegExpIdentifierName| which has a StringValue equal to the StringValue of the |RegExpIdentifierName| contained in |GroupName|.
          1. Assert: A unique such |GroupSpecifier| is found.
          1. Let _parenIndex_ be the number of left-capturing parentheses in the entire regular expression that occur to the left of the located |GroupSpecifier|. This is the total number of <emu-grammar>Atom :: `(` GroupSpecifier Disjunction `)`</emu-grammar> Parse Nodes prior to or enclosing the located |GroupSpecifier|.
          1. Call BackreferenceMatcher(_parenIndex_, _direction_) and return its Matcher result.

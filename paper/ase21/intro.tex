\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\begin{itemize}
  \item JavaScript is one of mainstream programming languages not only in
    client-side programming but also in serever-side programming and even
    embedded systems.

  \item Various JavaScript engines are developed and maintained in various
    fields and they must conform to the syntax and semantics described in
    ECMAScript, the standard specification of JavaScript.

  \item Since an incorrect description in ECMAScript can lead to the wrong
    implementation of JavaScript engines, it is important to check the
    correctness of ECMAScript.

  \item However, all the specification updates are currently manually checked by
    the Ecma Technical Committee 39 (TC39) without any automated tools.

  \item Moreover, in late 2014, the committee announced yearly release cadence
    and open development process of ECMAScript to quickly adapt to an evolving
    development environment.

  \item Thus, the manual checking becoems more labor-intensive and error-prone.

  \item To alleviate this problem, we propose $\tool$, an ECMAScript Static
    Checker based on Refinement Types.  Our tool performs the following three
    steps for a given specification: 1) to convert abstract algorithms in the
    specification to untyped intermediate representation, 2) to extract type
    information of data structures used in the specification, and 3) to perform
    type analysis with the extracted type information to detect specification
    errors.  Moreover, we use \textit{refinement types} over the extracted type
    information to reduce false alarms.  \inred{TODO: explanation of refinement
    types.}
\end{itemize}

Our main contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We implemented $\tool$, which is the first tool that statically checks the
    correctness of JavaScript language specifications using type analysis.  It
    can detect variuos kinds of specification errors including \inred{reference
    errors, $\cdots$}.
  \item We present \inred{...} to increase the precision of type analysis.
    \inred{$\cdots$}.
  \item We evaluate $\tool$ with \inred{XXX different versions of ECMAScript in
    the official repository between 2018 June and 2021 March.} Among \inred{XXX}
    known specification errors, our tool detected \inred{XXX} errors with
    \inred{XXX} false alarms.  Moreover, $\tool$ detected \inred{X} new
    specification errors in the draft of next release of ECMAScript (ES12,
    2021).
\end{itemize}

\begin{abstract}
  JavaScript is one of mainstream programming languages not only in client-side
  programming but also in serever-side programming and even embedded systems.
  Thus, various JavaScript engines are developed and maintained in various
  fields and they must conform to the syntax and semantics described in
  ECMAScript, the standard specification of JavaScript.  Since an incorrect
  description in ECMAScript can lead to the wrong implementation of JavaScript
  engines, it is important to check the correctness of ECMAScript.  However, all
  the specification updates are currently manually checked by the Ecma Technical
  Committee 39 (TC39) without any automated tools.  Moreover, in late 2014, the
  committee announced yearly release cadence and open development process of
  ECMAScript to quickly adapt to an evolving development environment.  Thus, the
  manual checking becoems more labor-intensive and error-prone.

  To alleviate this problem, we propose $\tool$, an ECMAScript Static Checker
  based on Refinement Types.  Our tool performs the following three steps for a
  given specification: 1) to convert abstract algorithms in the specification to
  untyped intermediate representation, 2) to extract type information of data
  structures used in the specification,  and 2) to perform type analysis with
  the extracted type information to detect specification errors.  Moreover, we
  use \textit{refinement types} over the extracted type information to reduce
  false alarms.  \inred{TODO: explanation of refinement types.} We evaluated
  $\tool$ with \inred{XXX different versions of ECMAScript in the official GitHub
  repository between 2018 June and 2021 March.} Among \inred{XXX} known
  specification errors, our tool detected \inred{XXX} errors with \inred{XXX}
  false alarms.  Moreover, $\tool$ detected \inred{X} new specification errors
  in the draft of next release of ECMAScript (ES12, 2021).

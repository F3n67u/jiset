    <step>Let <id>leafContext</id> be the running execution context .</step>
    <step>Suspend  <id>leafContext</id> .</step>
    <step>Pop <id>leafContext</id> from the execution context stack . The execution context now on the top of the stack becomes the running execution context .</step>
    <step>Assert : <id>leafContext</id> has no further use. It will never be activated as the running execution context .</step>

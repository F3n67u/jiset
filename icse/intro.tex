\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item JavaScript is a essential programming language in client-sides.
  \item Because of its complicated semantics, it is not easy to understand JavaScript program behaviors.
  \item Several exisiting proposed formal semantics of JavaScript, but these have the following limitations.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Fully manual implementation of parsers and interpreters.
      \item Supported only fixed version of ECMAScript (in most cases, ES 5.1).
    \end{itemize}
  \item We propose a way to automatically extract semantics from ECMAScript specifications and deal with its annual updates.
\end{itemize}

% There are several efforts to extract formal ECMAScript semantics for static analysis
% or verifications of JavaScript programs~\cite{???}. However, existing researches
% manually extract the semantics and only target specific version of
% EMCAScript specifications, mostly ECMAScript 5.1.
% It is the critical problem to treat real-world JavaScript programs
% because ECMAScript specifications are annually updated after 2015.
% 
% To alleviate such problems, we propose to automatically extract semantics from
% ECMAScript specifications. Their semantics are provided as \textit{abstract algorithms}
% written in structural natural langauges. Our main idea is to convert such algorithms
% into our small core languages. The algorithm converter consits of multiple rules
% for each layer. Moreover, we provide \textit{rule generation assistant}.
% It diagnoses root causes of failed conversions and suggests
% that which layer of rules should be extended for them.
